# Deal Monitor Logs

This directory contains daily log files generated by the deal monitor script.

## Log File Format

- `[INFO]` - Normal operations and status updates
- `[SUCCESS]` - Successful actions (notifications sent, etc.)
- `[WARNING]` - Non-critical issues (missing data, parsing errors)
- `[ERROR]` - Critical errors that prevent operations

## Troubleshooting with Logs

1. **No deals found** - Look for "Fetched 0 deals" or RSS parsing errors
2. **Filter issues** - Check for "Deal filtered out" messages
3. **Discord errors** - Search for "Failed to send Discord notification"
4. **Configuration errors** - Check startup messages for config loading issues
